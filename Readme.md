# What I used

- Since the assignment required Sass I used Vite build tool for a better development experience. Rollup will do the bundling for SCSS and JS. Alternative would be to use Webpack/snowpack/parcel/rollup but Vite offers a lot configuration.

# Start locally

npm run dev
http://127.0.0.1:5173/

# Build for production

npm run build
this will generate a JS bundle with Rollup in the dist folder.

# Time spent
